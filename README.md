The crowdsale contract will manage the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KSEI, or KaseiCoin tokens. the contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction. Crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.
